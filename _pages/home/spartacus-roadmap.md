#### General Release Information

We plan to publish new Spartacus libraries every two weeks. Each release may contain bug fixes, improvements to user experience, and new features.

When new features are available for release, normally we will publish a pre-release "next" version of the libraries with the new features, in order to get feedback. When the final, new, minor version is ready, we usually publish a release candidate (RC), with the final new 1.x.0 a  weeks later. For example, we will publish a few pre-release 1.4 "next" libraries in December, and then 1.4.0 will be released third week of December.

Some of the links provided in the following lists point to SAP Commerce Cloud Accelerator documentation, to give an idea of what the feature is about. These links are for context only. While we strive for feature parity, the Spartacus implementation of features may not work exactly as in Accelerator.

B2B features are based on the B2B Accelerator [Powertools store](https://help.sap.com/viewer/4c33bf189ab9409e84e589295c36d96e/latest/en-US/417df297eb39466288dd904e8acc426f.html). Many B2B features depend on new APIs that are scheduled for release in SAP Commerce during Q2 2020 or later.

  

#### Notes
Some items have notes, for example **(1)** or **(2)**
- **(1)**: The feature requires new OCC REST APIs that are planned for the next SAP Commerce release, scheduled for May 2020. These features may be available sooner to customers using SAP Commerce Cloud hosting services.
- **(2)**: The feature requires new OCC REST APIs, not yet planned.

- Accessibility Keyboarding: Group Skipping (WCAG 2.0, 2.4.1, Level A, Bypass Blocks)



  

## Planned for Rest of Q1 2020

*Exact dates to be determined*

A new major (2.0) is planned for mid-Q1 2020, primarily due to planned support for Angular 9 and the new Ivy rendering engine. The Accessibility features will also be part of the 2.0 release. The release of a new major version of Spartacus means that the code contains breaking changes.

#### Keyboarding-Related Accessibility Features

- Full Keyboard Support (WCAG 2.0, 2.1.1, Level A, Keyboard; WCAG 2.0, 2.1.2, Level A, No Keyboard Trap)
- Consistent Navigation (WCAG 2.0, 3.2.3, Level AA, Consistent Navigation)
- Tabbing/Reading Order (WCAG 2.0, 2.4.3, Level A, Focus Order)
- Focus Visible (WCAG 2.0, 2.4.7, Level AA, Focus Visible)

#### Move to Angular 9 / Ivy

- Move to Angular 9 (aiming for February 2020)
  - Schematics update for supporting migration
  - 3rd party dependencies updates
- Angular Ivy support (new compilation and rendering pipeline)
  - Smaller, simpler and faster
  - Better performance on mobile devices
  - Less memory used
  - Tree shaking for smaller packages

Stretch for 2.0 release:
- Extensibility Improvements (Sproutlets)
- Session Management (for better handling of authentication)
- Fetch Multiple CMS
- Directionality (for right-to-left display support)
- Performance improvements: Incremental loading of CMS data, the ability to fetch multiple CMS components at once, lazy loading, and above-the-folder UI loading
- Removal of ng Bootstrap
- Angular I18N support

#### Upgrading to 2.0 Notes ####

For upgrading to Spartacus 2.0, we’re working on a transition that will easy as possible. Typically we expect the update process to span as little as one hour, to at most one day, if being done by an experienced Angular developer.

There will be an update command (on top of Angular’s update command) that should take care of most changes automatically, including low-level changes. However, the exception might be if code has been extended or replaced by customers. Not all updates will be taken care of automatically, so we will be looking for feedback as release candidates are published.

Note: One low-level area to avoid at the moment is the Cart, as it is going through a refactor for 2.0 release.
